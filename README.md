# springboot-basic-secure-crud-demo
It's deployed on aws also. You can check it here: Erenspringdemo-env.eba-yafr8pkm.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com


A basic spring boot application that performs fully crud operations. I used spring data jpa as repository, saved me from much of boilerplate implementation code. 
And also I used lombok, It provides all the getters/setters etc. No need to write them.

You can examine aspect oriented programming also, It's so basic but after you log in, all the operations except getter/setters on employee repository are logged 
in the db, with the duration time, operation name and date.


I created a rest api also, for an angular app I might deploy it in future.
